This project comes from the Oracle Academy and is for educational purposes.
It was written using Google style java formatting in the intellij IDEA IDE.
The program is designed from the given scenario:

OracleProduction Ltd are specialists in producing production line 
manufacturing plants. They could be asked to create a production plant for
any type of product ranging from a simple packaging system to a variety of 
electronic devices. Recently they have been asked to create a production 
line for multimedia devices which include music and movie players. They wish
to employee you to design a template in Java for creating and recording all
future production line items. For this particular production facility you 
will only implement a concrete class for music and movie players.Your task
is to create a flexible structure that could be used in any production line. 
This structure would then allow easy modification to handle different products.

As of this point (September 28, 2018) the interfaces Item and MultimediaControl, 
the abstract class Product, and the enumerator ItemType have been created,
documented, and added to the project.
